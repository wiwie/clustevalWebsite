	{program_fullName: 'APcluster/apcluster', program_description: 'Affinity propagation performs the clustering by identifying exemplars (also called prototypes) among the available data points and reports their neighborhoods as clusters. It considers all data points as possible exemplars. The final set of exemplars is determined by sending messages between the data points voting for the best set of exemplars for the given similarity function in combination with the preference.'},
	{program_fullName: 'programs/ClusterDPClusteringRProgram.jar', program_description: 'Clusterdp is a recently published tool based on the idea that centroids are characterized by a higher local density (rho) than their neighbors and by a comparably high distance from objects with higher density. Rodriguez and Laio claim that the number of clusters arises intuitively and that clusters are recognized regardless of their shape and dimensionality of the space in which they are embedded.'},
	{program_fullName: 'clusterONE/clusterONE.sh', program_description: 'Clustering with Overlapping Neighborhood Expansion (ClusterONE) is a recently developed clustering method designed for detecting overlapping protein complexes in a given protein-protein interaction network. The primary concept behind the algorithm is the so-called cohesiveness measure, which is a combination of the number of reliable interactions within a cluster and the separation of the cluster from the rest of the network. We may apply ClusterONE to arbitrary data sets by transforming a given similarity matrix into a weighted similarity graph.'},
	{program_fullName: 'programs/DBSCANClusteringRProgram.jar', program_description: 'DBSCAN regards clusters of objects as dense regions that are separated by regions of low density. A certain minimum number of objects from each cluster is required to be within a certain distance. The number and the distance are user-given. Singletons are considered noise.'},
	{program_fullName: 'programs/FannyClusteringRProgram.jar', program_description: 'Fanny is a fuzzy clustering method requiring a distance matrix and the desired number of clusters as input. Fanny aims to find for each object the best membership vector describing the degree of membership of each object to each cluster by minimizing the sum of the average within-cluster distances weighted by the degree of the membership. This objective function is minimized numerically and the nearest crisp-clustering is reported as result.'},
	{program_fullName: 'programs/HierarchicalClusteringRProgram.jar', program_description: 'Hierarchical clustering creates a tree from a given set of objects. Each node in the tree represents a cluster. Agglomerative algorithms initially assign all objects to singleton clusters, which are merged based on their similarity (bottom-up). Divisive algorithms start with one big cluster, which is decomposed into smaller clusters along the tree (top-down). A linkage function determines the distance between two clusters. As linkage function, we use the Unweighted Pair Group Method using arithmetic Averages (known as UPGMA or average linking), which is probably the most popular algorithm for hierarchical clustering in computational biology'},
	{program_fullName: 'programs/KMeansClusteringRProgram.jar', program_description: 'K-means might be the most well-known clustering algorithm. Using the number of clusters k as parameter, k-means aims to iteratively minimize the within-cluster-sum-of-squares by assigning each object to the closest centroid (an artificial object) followed by a subsequent update of these centroids. The assignment after the convergence of this process is reported as clusters.'},
	{program_fullName: 'programs/KMedoidsClusteringRProgram.jar', program_description: 'In contrast to , Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) is one of the most common realizations of the k-medoid clustering approach, which uses exemplars as cluster centers. The algorithm works identical to k-means except that the exemplars are updated by testing each object in each cluster as exemplar instead of calculating artificial mean objects (centroids).'},
	{program_fullName: 'MCL/mcl-12-068', program_description: 'In Markov Clustering the input similarities are interpret as a graph on which densely connected areas are identified by simulating random walks. The clustering processes itself is performed by repeatedly alternating so-called expansion steps and inflation steps. The expansion steps allow simulated walks of long distances while the inflation steps sharpen the emerging local cluster structure.'},
	{program_fullName: 'MCODE/MCODE_wrapper_132.jar', program_description: 'Molecular COmplex DEtection (MCODE) is a graph based clustering method. In a first step the ’cliquishness’-score of all nodes is measured by taking into account the number of vertices and edges in the direct neighborhood. In a second step, clusters are built by starting at the vertex with the highest score followed by a recursive growing of these clusters by adding all neighboring nodes exceeding a certain score. MCODE may become extremely slow on large connected components in the similarity graph.'},
	{program_fullName: 'programs/SOMClusteringRProgram.jar', program_description: 'Self Organizing Maps (SOMs) involve training a neural network, where each neuron represents one centroid. The number of centroids (or the grid size) is a user-given parameter reflecting the number of clusters. The SOM aims at finding a set of neurons/centroids and to assign each object to the neuron that approximates that object best while iteratively imposing a topographic ordering on the neurons by influencing neurons that are close by. The output is a set of neurons that implicate clusters (objects are assigned to the closest neuron/centroid).'},
	{program_fullName: 'programs/SpectralClusteringRProgram.jar', program_description: 'Spectral clustering computes the second largest eigenvalue of the Laplacian of the similarity matrix to decide where to partition the similarity matrix. The resulting clusters may then be re-partitioned in order to generate a hierarchy. Efficient numeric algorithms solve the underlying linear algebra problems to facilitate spectral clustering on large datasets.'},
	{program_fullName: 'TransClust/TransClust.jar', program_description: 'Transitivity Clustering is based on the weighted transitive graph projection problem. A given similarity matrix is interpret as weighted graph and transformed into a so-called cost graph by removing edges weighted below a user-given threshold. Such a potentially intransitive graph is transformed into a transitive graph afterwards by adding and removing a minimal number of edges. Edge weights are taken into account by using a similarity-dependent cost function (the distance of the edge weight to the cutoff), which is to be minimized. A combination of exact and heuristic algorithms tackle this NP-hard problem. The number of clusters is influenced by the user threshold. The method guarantees that the mean similarity of objects within the same clusters is above the threshold, while the mean similarity between object from different clusters is below.'}])
